# Built With

JAVA, MySQL, Maven, Angular JS, BootStrap 

# How It Works

Have used Spring Boot, Spring JPA, Spring Web Services as the back-end. Angular JS as front-end to consume the rest-full spring services. MySQL to store the Users.

Have three API methods 
saveOrUpdateUser - Creates or Updates an User
deleteUser - Deletes an Existing User
getUsers - List downs all the available Users.

-- All the API's consume or produce JSON, using Angular JS in UI to do the CRUD opertions.
